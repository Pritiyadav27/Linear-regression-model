# Linear-regression-model
This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful Linear Regression Model, a fundamental algorithm in supervised machine learning. Linear regression is used to establish the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
